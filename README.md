Project Objective:
To develop an embedded system using ESP32 and the TGAM module to measure and analyze the driver’s brainwave signals. The project applies artificial intelligence to recognize the driver’s alertness state and provide appropriate stimuli to help maintain focus and vigilance, thereby reducing traffic accidents caused by distraction or drowsiness.

Project Description:
Hardware:
Utilizes ESP32 as the central processing unit connected with the TGAM module to acquire real-time EEG data.

Software:
Implements signal processing for noise filtering and extraction of important features from brainwave data.

Artificial Intelligence:
Applies AI models (e.g., neural networks or machine learning algorithms) to classify the driver’s cognitive states (alert, fatigued, drowsy).

Stimulus System:
Provides warnings or stimuli (such as sound or vibration) when distraction or drowsiness is detected to help the driver regain focus.

Key Highlights:
Successfully integrated ESP32 and TGAM module for stable real-time EEG acquisition in practical environments.

Developed effective algorithms for noise reduction and feature extraction from brainwave data.

Applied AI models for high-accuracy cognitive state classification, enhancing practical usability.

Designed a user-friendly alert interface to improve user experience.

Aimed to improve traffic safety by reducing risks related to distraction and drowsiness while driving.
